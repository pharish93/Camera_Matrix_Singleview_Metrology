Project 2 - ECE 592 Spring 2017  - Digital Image Processing 
How to use this project :- 

The code is wirtten for python 2.7 version and had library dependiencies on 
1. OpenCv 3. version
2. Numpy
3. Pylsd -- Liberary to do line segment detection(pip install pylsd)

Steps to follow
1. Input a image - which can be modified in the start if the code
2. Choose Debug option as True / or False depending on if you want to see images/intermediate results 
3. Let the Auto vanishing points code run
4. Start selecting the axis
5. Next please select the origin of the image box 
6. select a point on the x axis and enter the dimention/ length of the point from the oigin - this is used for determining the scaling factor 
7. Do if for all the 3 axis points - 
NOTE :- the order in which you do is important -- maintain the same order like the one used while drawing images
8. Modified images are displayed based on the projection matrix and the homographies  that are computed 

Note :-
Distances for the given image should be entered as 
430 along x direction 
330 along y direction 
110 along z direction
